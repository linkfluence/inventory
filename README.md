# inventory

Cloud agnostic inventory system currently supporting:

* AWS (ec2, RDS, elasticache) with multi-region
* OVH (baremetal and cloud though ovh API)
* Leaseweb (also called LSW) baremetal API only
* Alicloud Services (also called ACS, ecs service only)
* GCP (Only vm)
* Internal inventory

## Installation

Compile jar and create a conf file like one in conf/sample

## Storage

Inventory are basically stored in flat yaml files so it can be read easily, however for distributed setup the following storage are supported:

* yaml stored into aws s3 / gcp gs / aliyun oss
* yaml stored into local filesystem
* map stored into consul

Storage replication is fully asynchronous inventory aims to retains data in memory to be fast

## Cloud Autorization

### GCP

The following permissions are needed to gcp service account:

* compute.instances.get
* compute.instances.list
* storage.objects.create
* storage.objects.delete
* storage.objects.get
* storage.objects.list

The compute permissions are needed to build the inventory, the storage permissions are needed to store inventory state

## Usage

Launching

    $ java -jar inventory-0.16.10-standalone.jar conf/prod.clj
